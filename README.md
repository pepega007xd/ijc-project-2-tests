# ijc-project-2-tests
Collection of tests for the second homework in IJC course at BUT FIT.

## Usage
1. Build your project,
2. add files from this repo into your project's directory (assuming all project files are in one directory),
3. build the C++ implementation of `wordcount` (it is used as a reference),
4. build `test.c` using `gcc -o test test.c libhtab.a`,
5. run the tester by `bash test.sh`.

## Makefile
You can instead add rules in `Makefile.template` to your project's `Makefile`, which automates all steps to `make test`.

## Issues 
Feel free to report any issues with the tester, either here on Github, or on Discord (username `pepega007xd`).
