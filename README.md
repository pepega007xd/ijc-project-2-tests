# ijc-project-2-tests
Collection of tests for the second homework in IJC course at BUT FIT.

## Usage
1. Build your project,
2. add files from this repo into your project's directory (assuming all project files are in one directory),
3. build the C++ implementation of `wordcount` and name the binary `wordcount-cc` (it is used as a reference),
4. build `test.c` using `gcc -o test test.c libhtab.a`,
5. run the tester by `bash test.sh`.

## Results
The tester doesn't explicitly count passed/failed tests, the correct output should look like this:
```text
‚ùØ bash test.sh
testing tail...
test 2...
test 3...
test 4...
test 5...
test 6...
test 7...
test 8...
test 9...
test 10...
test 11...
ATTENTION: test 12... you should see just one error below, not five
ERROR: Maximum allowed line length is 4095. Line will be cut off.
testing hashtable...
testing wordcount...
ATTENTION: you should see just one error below, not five
WARNING: Maximum word length (255) exceeded.
```
You might see different error messages, those come from your project. 

## Makefile
You can instead add rules in `Makefile.template` to your project's `Makefile`, which automates all steps to `make test`.

## Issues 
Feel free to report any issues with the tester, either here on Github, or on Discord (username `pepega007xd`).

## Warning
Please don't submit any of the test files, I already submitted them myself.
